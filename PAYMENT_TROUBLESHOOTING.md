# Payment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "I paid money via UPI, but the order was not placed"

### Problem
You completed the UPI payment but the order wasn't processed in the system.

### Solution
The system now includes a manual payment confirmation button for real UPI payments. Here's how to complete your order:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Scan the QR Code**
   - Use any UPI app (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.)
   - Scan the QR code displayed on the payment screen
   - Complete the payment in your UPI app

2. **Wait for Confirmation Button**
   - After 30 seconds, a yellow confirmation button will appear
   - The button says "âœ… I have completed the payment"

3. **Click the Confirmation Button**
   - Click the button to confirm your payment
   - The system will process your order
   - You'll see "Payment confirmed! Processing your order..."

4. **Order Completion**
   - Your order will be saved to Google Sheets
   - Receipt will be generated
   - Order will appear in your order history

### Why This Happens

- **Real UPI payments** don't automatically notify the system
- **No webhook integration** exists for direct UPI payments
- **Manual confirmation** is required to complete the order process

### Alternative Solutions

#### For Production Use:
1. **Integrate with Payment Gateway** (Razorpay, PayU, etc.)
2. **Use UPI Intent APIs** for automatic confirmation
3. **Implement webhook endpoints** for payment notifications

#### For Current Setup:
- Always click the confirmation button after making UPI payment
- Check browser console for any error messages
- Contact support if issues persist

### Debug Information

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for error messages in the Console tab
   - Check for payment-related logs

2. **Verify Payment Details**
   - Ensure the amount matches your payment
   - Confirm the UPI ID is correct
   - Check that the order ID is displayed

3. **Common Issues**
   - Payment amount mismatch
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Browser compatibility problems

### Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Screenshot the error** (if any)
2. **Note the order ID** and payment amount
3. **Check browser console** for error messages
4. **Contact support** with the details

### Future Improvements

The system will be enhanced with:
- Automatic payment verification
- Real-time payment status updates
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Integration with payment gateways for automatic confirmation
