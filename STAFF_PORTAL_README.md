2. **Orders Not Appearing**

   - Verify order creation in customer portal
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Real-time Updates Not Working**

### Development Setup

1. **Firebase Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Ensure Firebase config is set up in .env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

2. **Firestore Rules**
   ```javascript
   // Example Firestore rules for orders collection
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /orders/{orderId} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Security Considerations

- API keys are environment-specific
