# 🔧 Build Script Fix Summary

## ✅ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

### **Problem:**
The Netlify build was failing with `vite: not found` error because:
- Our `netlify-build.sh` script was using `npm ci --only=production`
- This excluded dev dependencies (including Vite)
- Vite is required for `npm run build` to work

### **Solution:**
Changed the build script from:
```bash
npm ci --only=production
```

To:
```bash
npm ci
```

This ensures all dependencies (including dev dependencies) are installed.

## 🔍 **Why This Happened:**

1. **Production vs Development Dependencies**: 
   - `--only=production` excludes dev dependencies
   - Vite is listed as a dev dependency in `package.json`
   - Build tools are typically dev dependencies

2. **Build Process Requirements**:
   - `npm run build` executes `vite build`
   - Vite must be available during build time
   - Production-only installs don't include build tools

## 📋 **Current Build Process:**

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm ci` (includes all dependencies)
2. **Run Build**: `npm run build` (executes Vite)
3. **Verify Output**: Check for `dist` folder
4. **Success**: Build completes successfully

## 🧪 **Testing:**

The build script has been tested locally and works correctly:
```bash
./netlify-build.sh
```

## 🚀 **Expected Result:**

Netlify should now:
- ✅ Install all dependencies including Vite
- ✅ Successfully run the build process
- ✅ Generate the `dist` folder
- ✅ Deploy your React application

## 📚 **Key Takeaways:**

- **Build tools are dev dependencies** and must be available during build
- **Production-only installs** are for runtime, not build time
- **Always test build scripts locally** before deploying
- **Use `npm ci`** for reliable, clean installs in CI/CD

**The build script issue has been resolved!** 🎉

Your Netlify deployment should now proceed successfully through the build stage.
